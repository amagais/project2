There is no single face, age, or region of food insecurity, as it impacts every community in the United States.
Food insecurity is a complex issue. This nationwide problem is exacerbated by poverty, accessibility issues, and a dearth of government assistance.

Using data from the USDA Food Environment Atlas, we analyzed the impact of various food insecurity factors, such as low access to stores, fast food restaurant availability, and food assistance programs, both nationwide and in Illinois.
